Turn on the burner, make it go woosh
Get a wok from your wok shelf
Put a bunch of peanut oil on the sides of the wok, like a toilet duck (don't use that)
Then add a bunch of greens, vegetables and carrots
Then get some oyster sauce (made by soaking oysters for 4 weeks, smushing them, add some squid ink)
Done!
